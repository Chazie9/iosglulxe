Scrolling seems inadequate (try "look" in Advent). Need a "more" flag?

I dunno what's up with the fonts in iOS5.

Need a navbar with a "close keyboard" button

left/right pages for notes/map/etc

Gotta buffer GlkStream!

glulxercise failures: "all" doesn't come back -- too many lines in buf?

Make sure that @quit and VM-loop-exit wind up in the same state as glk_exit().
