(skip) Select/deselect the keyboard button as keyboard goes in/out.

(skip) Don't select a blank line as a paragraph?

(fuk dat) Can I use transitionFromViewController in the tab bar controller to animate swipes?

(nope) Test bluetooth keyboard; see about up/down arrows

(ignore) on iOS3, transcript viewer, action menu: "cancel" button doesn't work

(nobody cares) Note achievement strangeness on support page? (How to refetch missed achievements; command chains don't work.)

(enh) Stick a compass image behind the compass labels.

(1.2?) iCloud support. Also, DropBox support. (Requires UI thinking.)

Background color bug! (Changing color scheme when text is shorter than the screen.) Fixes on next layoutsubviews?

Style breaks shouldn't necessarily be wrap breaks. (E.g. "*command*")

While we're thinking about that, get images to work.

On iOS3/4, the notes page doesn't inset properly when the keyboard is open.

On iOS4, we should be retrying achievement failures.

Add a context menu (when selecting a word) to stick it into various common commands? (In the edit menu, or change double-tap?)

...We kind of need a magnifying reticle for that.

Can we make the bookmark button taller? Two-finger tap shortcut for that?

Glulx: if the game calls glk_exit(), the VM uses the "exited uncleanly" dialog. (Which is true; the VM's clean-up code was bypassed. Can we work around this?)
